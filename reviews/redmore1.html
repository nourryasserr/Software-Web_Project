      <p >Your guide to glowing and healthy skin</p>
      
      <section class="tips-details">
        <h2>1. Cleansing</h2>
        <p>Cleansing your face is the first step in any skincare routine. Use a gentle cleanser that suits your skin type to remove dirt, oil, and makeup.</p>
        

        <h2>2. Exfoliation</h2>
        <p>Exfoliate your skin 2-3 times a week to remove dead skin cells and improve skin texture. Avoid harsh scrubs to prevent irritation.</p>
        

        <h2>3. Toning</h2>
        <p>Use a toner to balance your skin’s pH levels and prepare it for better absorption of products. Choose alcohol-free toners for hydration.</p>
        

        <h2>4. Moisturizing</h2>
        <p>Hydrate your skin with a moisturizer that suits your skin type. Even oily skin needs moisture to maintain balance and prevent overproduction of oil.</p>
        

        <h2>5. Sun Protection</h2>
        <p>Apply sunscreen with at least SPF 30 every morning to protect your skin from harmful UV rays. Reapply every 2 hours when outdoors.</p>

        <h2>2. Hydrate Your Hair</h2>
        <p>Moisturizing your hair is key to preventing dryness and damage. Use deep conditioning treatments once a week to lock in moisture.</p>
        

        <h2>3. Use Heat Protection Products</h2>

        <h2>4. Avoid Over-Washing</h2>

        <h2>5. Maintain a Healthy Diet</h2>
        <p>A well-balanced diet rich in vitamins, proteins, and healthy fats can encourage strong, shiny hair. Consider adding biotin-rich foods like eggs and nuts to your diet.</p>
